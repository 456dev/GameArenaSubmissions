# FLIGHTLESS BIRD!
Agent Beak has been tasked by Colonel Flippers infiltrates the lair of the villainous W.O.L.F (Wicked Organization for Larceny and Fear)!

Only problem is......
Beak can only move using his trusty shotgun to launch himself around!
 
Fortunately all their operatives are on their annual teambuilding retreat at a relaxing spa in Iceland, so they will not hear the noise.

Can you help Agent Beak discover their evil plans before W.O.L.F returns?

# CONTROLS
Click to shoot towards the mouse.
The closer to the point of impact Beak is, the more momentum he will gain.
You must get to the door only using 10 shells.
Good Luck!
