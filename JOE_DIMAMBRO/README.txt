CONTROLS
w,a,s,d: to move 
j,k : to turn left and right respectively
 
 For this program to work move the yellow screen down to the bottom
 of your screen so you can still see the player display and make sure the yellow one was the last thing you clicked on, otherwise the controls don't work.

 turn around at the start.
 it's very much a work in progreess, Enjoy :)
